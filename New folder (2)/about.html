    <h2>
        Stone Fish
    </h2>
    <p>
        Stonefish are experts in camouflaging and can flawlessly blend into their surroundings, making it difficult for prey, predators, and even human SCUBA divers to notice them at all. They virtually always remain motionless on the ocean floor among the coral and rocky reefs that they favor as their habitat, and their colors frequently blend in flawlessly with the surrounding environment.
    <br>They do not aggressively hunt these creatures, but they do consume some invertebrates that live on the bottom and other reef fish. They choose to wait for food to be brought to them. Stonefish wait for hours before striking when their potential meal is only a body length away. They can readily suck down and swallow entire their unwary prey because of the pressure that their strong jaws and huge lips provide.

<h2>
    Flying Fish
</h2><p>
    Feeding on plankton crustaceans and other tiny invertebrates, tropical two-wing flyingfish. They can seek and eat individual plankton because they have huge eyes and strong vision. This stands in stark contrast to the very large-bodied filter feeders, which blindly filter enormous amounts of water to obtain enough food (such as the whale shark or basking shark). <br>
    The majority of flyingfish only exist offshore in the open ocean. However, tropical two-wing flyingfish are infrequently found living nearer the shore where they might be seen or caught. This species of flyingfish reproduces via broadcast spawning, in which numerous females release their eggs and numerous males discharge their sperm into the surface water at the same time. This is in contrast to some other species of flyingfish that attach their eggs to floating objects. By using this technique, it is more likely that fertilized eggs will get fertilized and less likely that egg predators will consume fertilized eggs.

<h2>
    Clown Triggerfish
</h2>
<p>
    The general name ‘triggerfish’ comes from the locking characteristic of the dorsal fin that all triggerfishes possess. The first dorsal-fin spine is large and strong and provides these fishes with some protection from predation. When it is erect (standing upright), it is locked in place by the second spine. The first spine can only be lowered after the second is pulled back, like a trigger. Few species are known to eat clown triggerfish.
<br>Male clown triggerfish are the first to arrive in spawning locations, where they establish and defend small territories because they are territorial. The males actively court the ladies as soon as they arrive, and the females choose which of the males they will mate with. A female chooses a partner, deposits her eggs in his area, and he fertilizes them right away. Together, they protect the nest from egg predators up to the time when the eggs hatch, at which point either the female visits another male or the mating season is over.

<h2>
seahorse
</h2><p>Pygmy seahorses, as their name implies, are tiny fish that are so well-camouflaged that they blend in with their surroundings. Since they blend in so perfectly, marine biologist George Bargibant had to collect and observe a host gorgonian before he could find Bargibant's pygmy seahorse.1 2

    The average size of a pygmy seahorse is 0.55 to 1.06 inches (1.4 to 2.7 cm).2 Bargibant's pygmy seahorse features spherical tubercles on its body that match the color and form of its host gorgonian coral and develops to a maximum length of 0.94 inches (2.4 cm). Depending on the color of the host gorgonian, this species is typically one of two colors: purple with pink tubercles or yellow with orange tubercles.</p>
<h2>
    Red Lionfish
</h2>
<p>The red lionfish hunts in ambush. It swims very slowly and frequently remains still as it watches for small fish to get too close before lunging viciously at its meal. At the same moment, it moves its jaws forward, creating a powerful suction that allows it to quickly swallow its victim completely. Almost any fish that fits in its mouth will be consumed by this species, which is not choosy about what it eats. The size of the prey that it can attack and consume also increases as it becomes bigger. Some have been seen leisurely circling their victim with their big fins before striking.

<h2>
    Slender Snipe Eel
</h2>
<p>
    The slim snipe eel is a predator that hunts pelagic crustaceans in the deep ocean's gloom. Scientists believe it takes its prey by swimming with its mouth open and cutting its head and "beak" side to side when it detects close prey. However, its habits are not fully known. Slender snipe eels are consumed by larger fish, such as some shallow-water species that dive for food (such as some tunas).

This species reproduces by broadcast spawning, in which the male and female release their sperm and eggs simultaneously into the water column. According to scientists, these species' individuals only spawn once before passing away, a life history approach shared by several other species including freshwater eels and Pacific salmon.
